This is a management site commissioned to me.
It's used to record information about kids who perform volunteering jobs in some organization.
They collect points working for these organization and later they can receive tokens to buy something in some company. 

The site has 2 levels of privileges, admin and manager.
An admin can delete and modify sensible data.

You can visit the demo at: http://www.untidy.org/tudu/
Logins: admin psw admin OR manager psw manager

Unfortunately the client did not need a localization system, so the site is entirely in Italian.
A localization system is supported but not fully implemented, maybe I will add it later.
